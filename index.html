                        <p><em>5 of us dined at this beautiful restaurant today. And we ALL agreed that the food and the service was impeccable.
                              The food all came out on HOT plates..(we were warned). The Steak was melt in the mouth, fish beautifully presented, and the pork belly to die for.
                              The signature rewena bread was awesome..and the paua fritter a close runner up.
                              Dishes were explained to us, and the service fantastic.
                              A must visit whilst in Kerikeri</em>em></p>
